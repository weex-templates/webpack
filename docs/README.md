# Introduction

This boilerplate is targeted towards large, serious projects and assumes you are somewhat familiar with Webpack and `weex-loader`. 

## Quickstart

To use this template, scaffold a project with [weexpack v1.1.1+](https://github.com/weexteam/weex-pack).

``` bash
$ npm install -g weex-toolkit
$ weex create my-project # default will create the webpack template
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
